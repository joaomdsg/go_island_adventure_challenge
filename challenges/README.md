# Challenges 🌊

Greetings Explorer! Let's have a quick chat before you venture fourth into your first challenge. 🦜💬

Within each of these directories, you'll uncover the secrets of its challenge:

- `README.md`: Delve into the detailed challenge description, revealing the problem statement, requirements, and any additional information to guide your quest.
- `main_test.go` and `main.go`: This is your battlefield of tests and code. Harness your skills, craft tests, and forge a solution that triumphs over the challenge. 

## Unleash Your Strategic Mind! 🎯

Chart unknown territories in the vast ocean of code. Start your expedition by etching an enigmatic map—a test—in `main_test.go`. Save it, then watch with anticipation as the waves crash in the `Run On Save Output`. Can't find it? Pay close atention then—turn your eye to your VSCode ToolBar > View > Output, then select "Run On Save" from the dropdown menu—Ahh.. there it is! Seeing your test fail initially is like discovering an uncharted island—it confirms our journey has purpose and isn't just meandering in familiar waters.

Now, you're given an isolated compass—your opportunity to plot a succinct path in `main.go`, navigating through the labyrinth—that is, to craft just enough of the implementation to make the test pass and turn it from a baffling maze into a shining victory.

Once you're assured of your maze trail and feel the sand between your toes, save the file and brace yourself. If your test passes, you've struck gold and your changes will be commemorated on the island. But if your test fails, a rogue wave washes ashore, erasing all traces of your recent efforts from the sands of both files. Hence, step lightly, adventurous code-navigator.

Embark on this thrilling cycle of exploration and discovery, guided by your tests like stars in the night, until you're standing on the summit of a fully-realized implementation. Happy coding, brave adventurer! ⚔️

## Got stuck? 🪨

If you hit a roadblock, don't sweat it... You can always cheat! 🏴‍☠️

Aye, it be true. The solutions to these here challenges aren't lost to the sea. They're safely stashed away in the [buried_treasure](../burried_tresure/) directory, waiting for some brave soul to unearth them. Here, you can have the key: 🗝️

Alright, that's enough chit-chat. Time to dive into the challenges and start your Island Adventure Challenge. Good luck, and happy coding, explorer! 🏝️😎
