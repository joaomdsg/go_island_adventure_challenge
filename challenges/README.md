# Challenges 🌊

Within the each directory, you'll uncover the secrets of the challenge:

- `README.md`: Delve into the detailed challenge description, revealing the problem statement, requirements, and any additional information to guide your quest.
- `main_test.go` and `main.go`: This is your battlefield of tests and code. Harness your skills, craft tests, and forge a solution that triumphs over the challenge. 

## Unleash Your Strategic Mind! 🎯

Chart unknown territories in the vast ocean of code. Start your expedition by etching an enigmatic map—a test—in `main_test.go`. Save it, then watch with anticipation as the waves crash in the `Run On Save Output Terminal`. Seeing your test fail initially is like discovering an uncharted island—it confirms our journey has purpose and isn't just meandering in familiar waters.

Now, you're handed a solitary shovel—your chance to write just enough code in `main.go` to dig up the buried treasure—that is, to transform the test from a perplexing riddle into a gleaming success.

Once you're assured of your treasure hunt and feel the sand between your toes, hit save and brace yourself. If your test passes, you've struck gold and your changes will be commemorated on the island. But if your test fails, a rogue wave washes ashore, erasing all traces of your efforts from the sands of both files. Hence, step lightly, adventurous code-navigator.

Embark on this thrilling cycle of exploration and discovery, guided by your tests like stars in the night, until you're standing on the summit of a fully-realized implementation. Adventure awaits!

Armed with this knowledge, venture forth into the challenges, conquer each one, and unlock the treasures that lie ahead! Happy coding, brave adventurer! ⚔️

## Got stuck? 🏖️

If you hit a roadblock, don't sweat it! You can always cheat 🏴‍☠️
 
## Solutions 💎

Aye, it be true. The solutions to these here challenges aren't lost to the sea. They're safely stashed away in the 'buried_treasure' directory, waiting for some brave soul to unearth them.

But remember, explorer: with great power comes great responsibility. The true adventure lies not in the destination, but the journey. So, we advise you not to dig up these solutions unless ye find yourself marooned, stuck between the rock of the challenge and the hard place of a relentless error message. 🦜

If ye find yourself in such a pickle, then by all means, let the 'buried_treasure' guide your way. But tread lightly, and remember: every challenge solved by your own wits is a victory against the unpredictable seas of coding. So, keep sailing, keep exploring, and make every line of code your own adventure! ⚓️🌊

Alright, that's enough chit-chat. Time to dive into the challenges and start your Island Adventure Challenge. Good luck, and happy coding, explorer! 🏝️😎
