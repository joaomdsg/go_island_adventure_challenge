// Welcome to the land of code, brave explorer! 🦜💬
//
// Here, in this wild and unpredictable terrain, every step you take can make all the difference.
// One false move, and you might lose your progress, it'll vanish like footprints in the sand.
// That's why it's so important to tread carefully, testing each little incremental change as you go.
//
// So here's your starting point: a challenge awaits, and a simple test to guide your way.
// Use it as a foundation to build your tests upon.
// Remember: every successful test is a step forward in your adventure! 🌴😎
