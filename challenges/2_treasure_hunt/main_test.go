// Hello again, brave explorer! ðŸ¦œðŸ’¬
// It's time to put your treasure hunting skills to the ultimate test.
// Tease out your solution incrementally, write a little test first, and make it pass, then repeat.
// Remember, one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind... if you're too ambitious, the island's
// magic will erase your progress up to the last successful state.
//
// Don't forget, each rule and condition is a vital part of the map to your treasure! Make sure to test
// them all thoroughly.
//
// Here is a test to start you out:

func TestFindTreasure_Simple_Path(t *testing.T) {

	islandMap := [][]int{
		{0, 1},
		{1, 2},
	}

	path, _ := FindTreasure(islandMap)

	assert.Equal(t, [][]int{{0, 0}}, path, "The function should return a correct path to the treasure")
}
