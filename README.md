# Island Adventure Challenge üèùüòé

Hey, there, brave explorer! Welcome to the Island Adventure Challenge, a coding journey like no other. If you're ready to sharpen your Go skills while having a whale of a time, you're in the right place. Each challenge is designed to bring you closer to becoming a master Go programmer while keeping things breezy, fun, and adventurous! ü¶úüí¨

This repo contains a series of challenges, each with their own unique twists and turns. The challenges are all Go-based and take the form of fun, island-related tasks. No need for heavy jackets or mittens here ‚Äì just pack your coding skills and a sense of adventure! üå¥

## Gear Up, Adventurer! üéí

Before we set sail, make sure you've got the right gear:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): It's not just the language of the challenge, it's the spirit of it! 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Git ready to clone, commit, and push your way to victory!
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or your preferred IDE): A real explorer needs the right tools. Set up camp with VS Code or your favorite IDE, just make sure it supports some kind of `run on save` feature.
- [Run on Save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave) (VS Code Extension) This is needed to enable TCR (Test && Commit || Revert), a coding style that makes the challenges extra spicy! üß®üß®üß®

> **Warning** <br>
> The TCR feature is only guarateed to work on Unix-like systems like Linux and macOS, as well as the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 
> If you're using a different operating system, you may need to find an alternative solution to enable the TCR coding style.

Got everything? Great! Adventure awaits!

## Set Sail! ‚õµÔ∏è

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. No machetes needed ‚Äì just a simple `git clone` will do!

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joaomdsg/go_island_adventure_challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd go_island_adventure_challenge
   ```

3. Install the necessary Go packages (like coconuts, but for your code).

   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

## TCR (Test && Commit || Revert) ‚ò†Ô∏è

We're using a TCR workflow here. It's kind of like those old pirate codes, but way more helpful (and with fewer peg-legged parrots). If your tests pass, your code gets committed automatically. If they don't, your changes get tossed overboard. Make sure to keep your code seaworthy!

We will wield the `emeraldwalk.RunOnSave` extension for this. Check out the [.vscode](.vscode) directory for the configuration that enables VSCode to work in TCR mode.

## Challenges üåä

Prepare to embark on a thrilling coding quest, where each challenge is housed in [challenges](./challenges). Within these enchanting directories, you'll discover the secrets of the challenge, waiting to be unraveled by your coding prowess.
