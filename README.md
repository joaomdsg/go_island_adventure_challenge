# Island Adventure Challenge 🏝😎

Hey, there, brave explorer! Welcome to the Island Adventure Challenge, a coding journey like no other. If you're ready to sharpen your Go skills while having a whale of a time, you're in the right place. Each challenge is designed to bring you closer to becoming a master Go programmer while keeping things breezy, fun, and adventurous! 🦜

This repo contains a series of challenges, each with their own unique twists and turns. The challenges are all Go-based and take the form of fun, island-related tasks. No need for heavy jackets or mittens here – just pack your coding skills and a sense of adventure! 🌴

## Gear Up, Adventurer! 🎒

Before we set sail, make sure you've got the right gear:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): It's not just the language of the challenge, it's the spirit of it! 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads): Git ready to clone, commit, and push your way to victory!
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (or your preferred IDE): A real explorer needs the right tools. Set up camp with VS Code or your favorite IDE, just make sure it supports some kind of `run on save` feature.
- [Run on Save](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=emeraldwalk.RunOnSave) (VS Code Extension) Enables TCR (Test && Commit || Revert) ☠️ coding style that make the adventures extra challenging!

>Note for intrepid explorers!
>
>The TCR feature works on Unix-like systems like Linux and macOS, as well as the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 
>If you're using a different operating system, you may need to find an alternative solution to enable the TCR coding style.

Got everything? Great! Adventure awaits!

## Set Sail! ⛵️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. No machetes needed – just a simple `git clone` will do!

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/joaomdsg/go_island_adventure_challenge.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```
   cd go_island_adventure_challenge
   ```

3. Install the necessary Go packages (like coconuts, but for your code).

   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

## TCR (Test && Commit || Revert) ☠️

We're using a TCR workflow here. It's kind of like those old pirate codes, but way more helpful (and with fewer peg-legged parrots). If your tests pass, your code gets committed automatically. If they don't, your changes get tossed overboard. Make sure to keep your code seaworthy!

Check out the [.vscode](.vscode) directory for the necessary settings and tasks for VSCode to work in TCR mode.

## Challenges 🌊

Prepare to embark on a thrilling coding quest, where each challenge is housed in [challenges](./challenges). Within these enchanting directories, you'll discover the secrets of the challenge, waiting to be unraveled by your coding prowess.

Within the each directory, you'll uncover the secrets of the challenge:

- `description.md`: Delve into the detailed challenge description, revealing the problem statement, requirements, and any additional information to guide your quest.
- `main_test.go`: This is your battlefield of tests and code. Harness your skills, craft tests, and forge a solution that triumphs over the challenge.

Armed with this knowledge, venture forth into the challenges, conquer each one, and unlock the treasures that lie ahead! Happy coding, brave adventurer! ⚔️

## Got stuck? 🏖️

If you hit a roadblock, don't sweat it! You can always cheat!
 
#### Solutions 💎

Aye, it be true. The solutions to these here challenges aren't lost to the sea. They're safely stashed away in the 'buried_treasure' directory, waiting for some brave soul to unearth them. 🏴‍☠️

But remember, explorer: with great power comes great responsibility. The true adventure lies not in the destination, but the journey. So, we advise you not to dig up these solutions unless ye find yourself marooned, stuck between the rock of the challenge and the hard place of a relentless error message. 🦜

If ye find yourself in such a pickle, then by all means, let the 'buried_treasure' guide your way. But tread lightly, and remember: every challenge solved by your own wits is a victory against the unpredictable seas of coding. So, keep sailing, keep exploring, and make every line of code your own adventure! ⚓️🌊

Alright, that's enough chit-chat. Time to dive into the challenges and start your Island Adventure Challenge. Good luck, and happy coding, explorer! 🏝😎
